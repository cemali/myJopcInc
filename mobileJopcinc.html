            <ARTICLE><P>JOPC Inc is a day care center, a non-profit organization designed for disabled and older adults who can no longer manage independently, or who are isolated and lonely. Our program enables the disabled and seniors to socialize with others while still receiving needed care services. At the same time, we offer caregivers a break from care-giving duties while knowing that their loved one is in good hands. The center boasts a planned program of activities designed to promote well-being through social and health-related services. JOPC Inc. operates during daytime hours, Monday through Friday, in a safe, supportive and cheerful environment. We also offer nutritious meals that accommodate special diets, along with an afternoon snack.</P></ARTICLE>
