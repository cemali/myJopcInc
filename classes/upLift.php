<p>But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in and confidently rely on the loving-kindness and the mercy of God forever and ever.  9 I will thank You and confide in You forever, because You have done it (delivered and kept me safe) I will wait on, hope in and expect in Your name, for it is good, in the presence of our saints (Your kind an pious ones) Psalm 52: 8-9 AMP bible.</p>
