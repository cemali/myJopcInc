                 <ARTICLE><P>In our adult day program, we primarily serve adults age 62 and older but also provide services to younger adults who have the need for care and supervision, if the needs are similar to the main population of participants. Our outreach ministry will serve our city and surrounding neighborhood. During this economic time, we shall seek to provide an open hand to those who are in need.</P></ARTICLE>
