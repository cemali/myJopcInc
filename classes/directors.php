                <hr><h2>Richard McLean</h2></hr>
<p>
       Richard McLean moved to Atlanta so he could study engineering at  Georgia Tech. After Graduation in 1983, he went to work in the  computer industry. He started out selling the first IBM Personal  Computers to large corporations all across the U.S. . In 1990, Richard  and three other partners started a new company with selling Super  Servers. Driving home from work one evening in October 1994, Richard's  life would be changed forever at 40. A deer jumped out from nowhere  and swerving to miss the deer his car rolled down a hill. Richard  would be paralyzed from the chest down for the rest of his life. After  doing months of rehab at the Sheppard Center, he was sent to a nursing  home to finish up. While in the nursing home, he was amazed at the  lack of compassion there was for the elderly. With the help of a home  health aide, Richard was able to return to work and move into an apartment by himself. That is how he met Joyce Obele. Richard realized  from his own experience what a difference it makes if the caregivers  are compassionate and positive. When Joyce told him about the business  they were starting, he thought of the elderly back in the nursing home  and wanted to make a difference.
